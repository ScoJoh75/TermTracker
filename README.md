# TermTracker
This is a handy little Android app for tracking College terms as well as the courses within them. You can also add tests and projects to each course and also set notifications by due dates.

I learned the basics of working in Android. 
In uses recyclerviews to create a list of Terms, then on selecting a term you get a list of courses in that term. 
Clicking a course gives you a list of tests and projects in that course.
You can also set reminders and notifications for courses and tests.
